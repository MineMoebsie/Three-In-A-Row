# Three-In-A-Row

A small and simple game that can be played with 2-4 people (on 1 computer/laptop)

Small game description:
Three In A Row is a basic game where you have to make rows of three either diagonally, vertically or horizontally. However, the map can also expand from a 3x3 area to an 5x5 area (to an 7x7 area etc.). You can play with up to four players and the goal is to get the most covered area. You can cover area on the board by making rows of three. Of course, these can also be rows of four, or five etc.


Requires python, pygame and numpy (see requirements.txt)

I made this very quickly, so the code is messy...
